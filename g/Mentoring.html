	  <li>Grant proposals/collaborations:
	    <ul>
	    <li>Any possible collaborations from EAB meeting on Oct 13?</li>
	    <li>Don't hear back from Prof. Chauchyun Chen on Molecular Dynamic simulation.</li>
	    <li>Will set up a meet with Arvind Ramanathan for the last week of October.</li>
	    <li> Working with <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/people/nico-franz">Prof.Nico Franz <a> on a proposal
	    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
	    This is my idea about grant submission: Nico and Beltram's group use <a href="https://github.com/EulerProject">Euler</a> as a logic-based reasoning model to compare/analyze two input classifications based on some predefined rules by experts. 
	    Dr. Hong Cui focuses more on similarities and differences of biological characteristics of organisms to come up the taxonomic classifications:  
	    <a href="http://taxonconceptexplorer.org/public/images/0/08/ETC-ProjectDescription.pdf"> ETC proposal</a>, <a href="http://taxonconceptexplorer.org/pub/Main_Page"> ETC site</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1147266"> NFS 1147266</a>, and 
	    <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1643002"> NSF 1643002</a>.

	    Target NSF grant: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5129&org=DBI&sel_org=DBI&from=fund"> https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5129&org=DBI&sel_org=DBI&from=fund</a>
	    <br>

		My idea is to extract the hierarchical structures of species from articles, journal papers, and other reliable resources such as <a href="https://www.dataone.org/"> dataOne </a>(using text mining). After having the extracted hierarchies (of course with many conflicting knowledges and ambiguities), we can compare/analyze with existing classifications to try to resolve these ambiguities/conflicting evidences. Visualizations can greatly help with this process.

	   	<li>Looking for grant for the biological network map. This is an <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1260795"> example NFS grant</a> in this research of <a href="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~jichen/Webhome.html">Prof. Jian Chen</a>. </li>
	   	</ul>
	  </li>

	  <li>Paper submissions:
	    <ul>
	    <li>Last week, I have submitted a paper to <a href="http://pacificvis.snu.ac.kr/">PacificVis 2017</a>: <i> CactusTrees: Visualizing Structure and Connectivityin Hierarchical Datasets</i>. Here is the <a href="http://pacificvis.snu.ac.kr/">project website</a></li>
	    <li>I will submit another short paper to <a href="http://pacificvis.snu.ac.kr/">PacificVis 2017</a>: <i> BioLinker: Bottom-up Exploration of Protein Interaction Networks </i></font>. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/BioLinker">project website</a></li>
	    
	    <li>Working on a paper for <a href="http://eurovis2017.virvig.es/"> EuroVis 2017</a> on <i> Detecting significant varables in large datasets using Scagnostics measures</i> with my previous PhD advisor. <br>This paper dues on <b>5th December, 2016</b></li>
	   	</ul>
	  </li>	  
	  <br>
	  <li>Traveling for conferences/talks:
	    <ul>
	    <li> Planning on going to <a href="http://ieeevis.org/">VIS 2016</a>. I am in the OC, and also invited as the Session Chair at <a href="http://biovis.net/2016/program_ieee/"> BioVis 2017</a>. <br>	    
	    I also hope to find collaborations and good students here
	    </li>
	    <li> Talk proposal is accepted at Cambridge Healthtech Institute’s 16th Annual <a href="http://www.bio-itworldexpo.com/"> Bio-IT World Conference & Expo </a> on May 23-25, 2017</li>
	   	<li> How to cover class on conference travel?</li>
	   	</ul>
	  </li>	 
	  <br>
	   <li> Lab settings:
	    <ul>

	  <li> PhD students and RAs:
	    <ul>
	    <li> Vinh The Nguyen got admission letter and will start with the Visa interview</li>
	    <li> I am interviewing 4 more students for the RA. Yasin Kabir is good compared to other. Here is <a href="http://www.mykabir.info/resume/"> his resume</a>. He is half way of the interview process but I want to give a head up.</li> 
	    <li> Tahrima Mustafa, currently on the 2nd year of her PhD at TTU CS, wants to work with me on visulization and would like to get supports soon.  Here is <a href="files/Tahrima_Mustafa.pdf"> her resume</a>.</li>
